/// The values specified in a view instance location structure can be added to ViewportArrayIndex and RenderTargetArrayIndex values output by the shader prior to rasterization to compute the final effective index of the viewport and render target to send primitives to.
/// If a computed index is out of range (that is, when the index is larger than the number of viewport or render target elements in their respective arrays) then the effective index becomes 0.
/// For shaders that dynamically select the viewport or render target indices, an application can set all the view instance locations declared in a PSO to the same value to act as a uniform base value for all views.
